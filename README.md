You just need to copy the folder of the desired application to your
web server directory (/var/www). No databases or any other library
is used (except from jquery that is included in the corresponding 
folder when used). 

Current list of offline apps (partially) implemented:

- My stupid forum: a simple version of the http://stupidforum.com (by Miltos Manetas) without some of the nasty features (the need to press save quickly) and with a refresh mechanism. An admin panel that will allow the adminstrator to decide on the number of text areas, their size, etc. under construction.

- QuestionApp: a very simple poll/questionnaire based on DRBPoll <http://www.dbscripts.net/poll/> with the addition of a simple admin panel for configuring easily the question/answers. Additional configuration options (e.g., changing the SSID, possibly with a short version of the question) under construction.

You can see the applications running at: http://nethood.org/toolkit/
